Implementing lazy functional languages on stock hardware: the Spineless Tagless G-Machine
=========================================================================================

Slides for my Papers We Love talk in Cambridge on July 11th, 2017.

The final presentation is in ``slides.pdf``, this should be viewed in
presentation mode or paged.

The source for the slides is ``slides.tex``, these can be built into the pdf
with ``make``. The latex requires ``beamer`` installed.

``map.c`` contains mostly complete C code that could have been generated from a
haskell ``map`` function. This is meant to illustrate some of the concepts in
the paper.
